I'm now an Assistant Professor in Department of Computer Science and Technology, School of Informatics, Xiamen University. I received my PhD degree on computer science from Hong Kong Baptist University in 2019 supervised by [Prof. Yiu-ming Cheung](http://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~ymc/) and received my bachelor and master degree on software engineering from University of Macau in 2012 and 2014, supervised by [Prof. Yuan Yan Tang](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/yytang/). I was a research intern at Tencent in 2018. My research interest includes artificial intelligence, machine learning. My research direction is trustworthy deep learning, including long-tail learning, federated learning, label-noise learning and continual learning.

## Research Interests

### Deep Learning with Incomplete Labels

Machine learning with incomplete labels addresses effective model training in the presence of significant label deficiencies, such as imbalanced label distribution or noisy labels. The goal is to achieve accurate predictions despite low data quality. We enhance model performance on incomplete labeled data by introducing more effective label processing and integration strategies.

### Trustworthy Federated Learning

Trustworthy federated learning aims to perform model training in a distributed data environment, ensuring data privacy and security while maintaining high model performance. It also explores personalization and fairness within the federated learning framework. Our work focuses on data heterogeneity, long-tailed distribution, missing labels, and noise issues, improving the robustness and performance of models in heterogeneous data and noisy environments.

### Continual Learning and Prompt Learning

In real-world applications, the data environment is dynamically changing, and models need to continuously learn new knowledge while retaining existing knowledge without forgetting. Our research involves task-imbalanced continual learning, concept drift handling in incremental learning, and domain generalization, aiming to enhance model stability and adaptability in dynamic and imbalanced data environments.
