I'm now an Assistant Professor in Department of Computer Science and Technology, School of Informatics, Xiamen University. I received my PhD degree on computer science from Hong Kong Baptist University in 2019 supervised by [Prof. Yiu-ming Cheung](http://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~ymc/) and received my bachelor and master degree on software engineering from University of Macau in 2012 and 2014, supervised by [Prof. Yuan Yan Tang](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/yytang/). I was a research intern at Tencent in 2018. My research interest includes artificial intelligence, machine learning. My research direction is trustworthy deep learning, including long-tail learning, federated learning, label-noise learning and continual learning.
