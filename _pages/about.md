I'm now an Assistant Professor and PhD supervisor in Department of Computer Science and Technology, School of Informatics, Xiamen University. I'm also the joint supervisor at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Xiamen University. I received my PhD degree in computer science from Hong Kong Baptist University in 2019, supervised by [Prof. Yiu-ming Cheung](http://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~ymc/), and received my bachelor and master degrees in software engineering from University of Macau in 2012 and 2014, supervised by [Prof. Yuan Yan Tang](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/yytang/). I was a research intern at Tencent in 2018. I have published over 50 top-tier papers, many of which have been featured in top-tier AI and computer vision conferences (CCF-A) like CVPR, NeurIPS, ICCV, AAAI, IJCAI, and MM. I have led several projects, including the Key Project, General Project, Youth Project and the China-British International Exchaneg Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Fujian Provincial Excellent Youth Project, the Major Project of the Fujian New Think Tank, the General Project of the Fujian Natural Science Foundation, and open projects at the Zhejiang Lab. I serve as a member of the Machine Vision Committee, the Secretary-General of the Xiamen Member Activity Center of the China Society of Image and Graphics, and IEEE senior member. I also serve as the Associate Editor of the international journal IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence. I was honored as the "Xiaomi Young Scholar" in 2023, and obtained the best paper award on DOCS 2024. My research interests include deep learning and computer vision. My research direction is trustworthy deep learning, including long-tail learning, federated learning, label-noise learning and continual learning.

## Research Interests

### Deep Learning with Incomplete Labels

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">  
    <div style="flex: 1;">         
        <p>             
    Machine learning with incomplete labels addresses effective model training in the presence of significant label deficiencies, such as imbalanced label distribution or noisy labels. The goal is to achieve accurate predictions despite low data quality. We enhance model performance on incomplete labeled data by introducing more effective label processing and integration strategies.

### Trustworthy Federated Learning

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">   
    <div style="flex: 1;">         
        <p>             
    Trustworthy federated learning aims to perform model training in a distributed data environment, ensuring data privacy and security while maintaining high model performance. It also explores personalization and fairness within the federated learning framework. Our work focuses on data heterogeneity, long-tailed distribution, missing labels, and noise issues, improving the robustness and performance of models in heterogeneous data and noisy environments.

### Continual Learning and Prompt Learning

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;"> 
    <div style="flex: 1;">         
        <p>             
    In real-world applications, the data environment is dynamically changing, and models need to continuously learn new knowledge while retaining existing knowledge without forgetting. Our research involves task-imbalanced continual learning, concept drift handling in incremental learning, and domain generalization, aiming to enhance model stability and adaptability in dynamic and imbalanced data environments.
